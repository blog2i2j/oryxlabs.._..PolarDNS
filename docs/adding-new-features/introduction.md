# Introduction

Adding new features to PolarDNS is essential for discovering truly novel DNS issues. And with PolarDNS, you can do just that relatively easily.

PolarDNS allows you to quickly add a new feature, try out your ideas, or develop a PoC without having to build your own DNS server. All you need is ability to understand Python code and a curiosity to experiment with the DNS protocol.
