# Bad Compression

Modules in this category enable experimentation with various malformations in the DNS compression scheme, including pointer loops, forward pointers, double compression, and offset manipulation across different fields of DNS messages.

These modules can help assess how resolvers and clients handle non-standard or malformed compression structures.
