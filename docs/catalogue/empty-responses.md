# Empty Responses

Modules in this category are designed to respond with an incomplete, misleading, or empty responses of various types.

Some modules also implement query reflection, where the original query is sent back to the sender.

Additionally, other unexpected response behaviors are supported, such as abandoning the connection (causing a timeout) or deliberately closing the connection.
