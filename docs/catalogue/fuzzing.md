# Fuzzing

Modules in this category are designed for experimenting with various domain name malformations, supporting multiple resource types.

These modules enable testing of oversized domain names and subdomains, permitted characters in domain names, and how domain names are encoded and transmitted over the network using [DNS name notation](http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_DNSNameNotationandMessageCompressionTechnique.htm).
